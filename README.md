# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible and 
to leave the code a little cleaner than how I found it.

## Improvements 

1. Added semantic HTML elements
2. Improved logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. Added accessible alt attributes
4. Made sure the heading attributes fall in sequential order
5. Changed and added a descriptive title for website
6. Fix the links on the webpage

## New and Improve Website
